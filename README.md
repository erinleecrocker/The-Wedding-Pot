# The Wedding Pot  ![<Test>](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg) 

This project was created for the intents and purposes of building a wedding event bidding website. The objective of the project was for the users to be able to come to our website, make a profile, create their event posting, and post their events for vendors to view. On the vendor side, we wanted them to bid on these events after being able to view them. All of the event details will be gathered from user input. The data will go through CRUD routes and stored on a mySQL database. Execution of this project required our team to: <ul>
<li> Utilize npm packages to access mySQL, express, and passport functions
<li> Being able to use mySQL workbench to generate the database
<li> Understanding of API routes in order to get, post, and delete our data
</ul>

The project is done through the use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) with aide from [NPM documentations](https://www.npmjs.com/).

# Usage

Access the webpage by going to this link [HERE](https://still-plains-42987.herokuapp.com/) 

Or copying and pasting this link to your browser: https://still-plains-42987.herokuapp.com/

The link will take you to the website's homepage which is shown here:

Example: <img src="images\Home Page.png" alt="HomePageExample">

From there you can choose to proceed as a customer or as a vendor. 

If you signed up and log in as a customer you will be presented with a profile page like the example below: 

Example: <img src="images\Customer Profile.png" alt="HomePageExample">

From there you can view all of your events and proceed to create an event. 


Event creating will then take in your user inputs. All required fields will need to be filled in order to proceed to the next screen. 

Example: <img src= "images\Create event.png" alt="ProfilePageExample">


All created events will be shown on the user profile. 


Vendors will take a similar routing. They will be able to sign up using our form:

Example: <img src="images\Vendor Signup.png" alt="HomePageExample">


After signing in, vendors can then view all events created on our website and interact with them. 

Example: <img src="images\Vendor page.png" alt="HomePageExample">
